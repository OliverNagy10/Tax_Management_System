# Tax Management System Readme

## Overview

This Tax Management System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the management of property-related information for tax purposes. It includes functionalities for handling property details, owners, payments, and users. The system is equipped with both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) to cater to different user preferences.

## Getting Started
